Folder layout:

./buildtools - things needed for building (except for makefile)
./cli - code specific to command line interface
./gui - code specific to graphical user interface
./include - header of fsqlf library
./lib_fsqlf - code of fsqlf library
./tests - tests
./utils - generic code of considerable size. External code files also go here.


Shortnames used:

'kw' - keyword with all its settings
'kwmap' - collection of all 'kw's
'nl', 'tab', 'sp' - new line, tabulation/indentation, space character.


Code style:

Dialect: C99.
Target platforms: windows and linux (though even better if more).
Indentation: 4 spaces (no tabs).
Line limit: 79 characters (soft).
Exported public symbols: prefix "fsqlf_".
Exported private symbols: prefix "FSQLF_" (static functions don't need these).
Also, names of similar things, should share same prefix. (mimic namespacing)
Avoid typedef'ing structs. (only if need to hide or separate from struct)
Follow K&R style.
External code files should go under utils, and follow their own conventions.


Code style illustration:
----
#include <stdio.h> // puts()


char * FSQLF_first()
{
    // For things that have names (functions, structs, enums),
    // opening curly brace goes on new line.
    if (1 == 1) {
        // Opening bracket for if/for/while/switch go on same line.
        return NULL;
    }
}


// Two lines between adjacent functions.
// (same for any other significant top level blocks)
// If there is need to split arguments on separate lines,
// closing parenthesis goes on new line.
static void second(
    struct long_configuration *cfg,
    char *out_buffer
)
{
    puts(FSQLF_first());
    puts(
        "NULL"
    );
}
